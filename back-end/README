Inside the backend folder you can directly execute:

1. ./gradlew build

2. ./gradlew run


This will launch the backend and report any request received.

If you want to form an HTTPS API request to the server, run a command of this form from another terminal:

-curl --location --request POST 'https://localhost:8765/energy/api/...' -H 'Name: Value' --insecure

where the -H attribute represents a header with name 'Name' and value 'Value'.
